## Trivia Application

## Features

1. Displays questions - both all questions and by category.
2. Deletes questions.
3. Adds questions and requires that they include question and answer text.
4. Searches for questions based on a text query string.
5. Has a quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Tasks

There are `TODO` comments throughout project. Start by reading the READMEs in:

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. This order will look familiar from our prior work in the course.

## About the Stack

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
